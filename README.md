__Prompts used.__  
Initial prompt was far from perfect, but anyway, it worked
```
how can i write a code for a web application that displays isometric or like view of a 3D mesh-represented surface that user could then rotate with a mouse to change view angles? Surface picture may be wireframe or preferably colour-coded (height in Z direction is colour-coded)? Application should run in browser and use any language that is availble, e.g. javascript.
```

```
now i want to split window into 2 panes - left one with the list of surfaces to select and the right pane to display a clicked surface. Generate 3 different surfaces and put clickable links to them into the left pane.
```
